# Movies Recommendation Engine

We want to recommend movies a user might enjoy based on ratings they and others have given a list of movies.

## Datasets

There is a set of `user_id`, `movie_id`, and `rating` (from 1-5) that is available via:

```bash
wget http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k.zip
```

This data has been unzipped and posted on the `movielens-recs` S3 bucket.

## Modeling Strategy

This is our modeling strategy.

## End Goal

This is what we want to accomplish.
